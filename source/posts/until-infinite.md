# Until Infinite

May 6, 2024

Non-market socialism will never exist until economic theory is redundant altogether. In a finite world, there will always be a need for trade, and therefore, a need for a medium.

Unless individuality is banned altogether, even in a socialist utopia of free goods for all, our own individuality will conjure needs and wants which a universal support system could never fulfill.

For instance, imagine a necklace made with an incredibly rare material. Not everyone can be given a necklace because of its rarity, so if a collection of people want the necklace, who is given it? The answer is the person who will give the most for it, i.e. through trade.

So if you hate money, you are out of luck. Money will always be relevant until there is practically an infinite amount of everything.
