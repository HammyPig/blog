# Utopia

What does utopia look like? The most basic utopia is one community with one unified shared set of values. This society would exist in any form, whether it be a small tribe, or billions of people in a modern world. Its existence is predicate only on a single assumption, that deep down - underneath the mess and obfuscation of our own personal biases, traumas, and grievances - humanity shares a single unified set of values.

If this assumption is wrong, and there is in fact many individual conflicting sets of values, utopia would split from its one single home into a near infinite set of unique communities. This evolution would then require additional assumptions:

- Large population: If there are not enough people, some may not find a large enough community that fits their own values.
- Large amount of land: There must be enough land to accommodate all communities.
- Fast transportation: To cross large amounts of land requires high amounts of speed.
- Freedom of choice and movement: No-one to stand in the way of someone reaching their desired home.

On Earth, each person would be entitled to their own share of land usage - land which can be lended but never be sold. From this, communities would collate their land into their own pockets of the world, with each community supporting a shared venture of transport infrastructure for the common hope that more will join them.

If our homeworld is too small to accommodate the resulting set of communities, we would look to the stars - practical only with FTL technology. Humanity, then, would span the galaxy. With 500 million habitable planets in our Milky Way, estimating 10 billion inhabitants on each, an individual would be one in a near-quintillion.[^planetary_habitability] Entire planets could dedicate themselves to their own unique values. For the individual, a practically infinite amounts of options.

In either form, communities are always predicate on consent. Anything otherwise is a violation to the core values of freedom of choice and movement. Something like slavery would never exist, but a super murder society (where everyone is happy killing each other, of course) certainly could.
