# Nomad Build

If one wishes to live a nomadic lifestyle, what items should they own? Here I will present an item list which all fits inside a single 40L backpack. This ensures that you don't need to rely on any storage, or vehicle to move things around. Additionally, having it all in a backpack keeps your hands free when on the move.

## Item list

**Clothes**
- 3 Shirts
- 2 Pants
- 5 Socks
- 5 Underwear
- Singlet: Can be worn as nightwear, or for extra warmth.
- Swim Trunks: Lightweight and enables swimming. Doubles as shorts.
- Jacket: Waterproof. Can be used for the rain or for warmth.
- Shoes
- Flip-flops: Avoid stepping on dirty shower floors.

**Luggage**
- 40L Backpack: Can be brought on a plane as a carry-on, and enables your hands to be free.
- Non-TSA Luggage Lock: Attached to backpack. Avoid TSA as they have a security flaw, allowing random people to open them. Additionally, TSA locks were designed for check-in luggage, not carry-on.
- Messenger Bag: Used as a daypack for carrying around e.g. a water bottle.
- Packing Cubes: Better backpack storage management.

**Daily Use**
- Hand Sanitiser: Put in daypack. When your out but can't wash your hands.
- Water Bottle: Stay hydrated.

**Technology**
- Phone, Phone Charger
- Laptop, Laptop Charger, Laptop Case: Avoid if you can as can be quite heavy and annoying.
- Earphones
- Earphone Case: Coords don't get tangled or ripped.
- Door Lock: For security and peace of mind.

**Toiletries**
- Toothbrush, Toothpaste: Dental care is important.
- Tweezers, Nail Clippers: Can be extremely annoying without.
- Face Towel: Avoid dirty hostel towels.

**Comforts**
- Earplugs: Mute loud noises when attempting to sleep, e.g. snoring hostel guests.
- Sleeping Bag: avoid dirty bedding.

**Documents**
- Passport
- Driver's License

## Personal experience

I have yet to do long-term travelling, so this list primarily comes from my experience on a few short trips. However, I'll continue to update this list when necessary.

## Researching existing item lists

Out of curiosity, I also did some research to discover what other people's nomad build looked like. First I went to [The Digital Nomad subreddit wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/wiki/quick_start/#wiki_what_to_bring), though surprisingly it did not contain anything too useful, and only provided a vague idea of packing light.

The next resouce I went to was the One Bag subreddit. The subreddit wiki links to the [One Bag website](https://www.onebag.com/). Here they provide an incredibly extensive list of items, which I have collapsed into dropdown menus for your convenience:

Initially I wasn't even going to mention this list as it seemed to be more akin to an apocalypse survival kit than a lightweight nomad build. However, I then saw that the authors advised that this list should serve instead as the scope of all possible items you could possible bring, i.e. if you were considering taking something on a trip which was **not** on this list, it definitely should not be brought.

Additionally, the One Bag site provides extensive descriptions on the use cases for each item to assist you in filtering it down to your individual needs.
