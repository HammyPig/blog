# Nomad Build

If one wishes to live a nomadic lifestyle, what items should they own? Here I will present an item list which all fits inside a single 40L backpack. This ensures that you don't need to rely on any storage, or vehicle to move things around. Additionally, having it all in a backpack keeps your hands free when on the move.

## Clothes

### Upperbody

<table class="table">

    <tr>
        <td>Down Jacket</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="https://www.patagonia.com.au/products/mens-torrentshell-3l-rain-jacket-85241-enlb">Rain Jacket</a></td>

To provide comfort in all seasons while minimising weight, I use a modular layering system made of three components:

- Base layer: Prevents sweat from building up on the skin by wicking it away from the body.
- Mid layer: Provides warmth.
- Outer layer: Keeps wind and rain out.

For my base layer, I use a merino long sleeve shirt. Merino is a type of wool which is softer than regular wool, making it less itchy on the skin. Wool is excellent at drawing moisture away from the body, as opposed to something like cotton, which retains sweat and makes you colder.

For the mid layer, I use a merino jacket, down jacket, or both, depending on the desired temperature.

For the outer layer, I use a rain jacket with pit zips, which help with ventilation as rain jackets typically make you feel very humid.

### Lowerbody

<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th>Item</th>
        <th>Weight (g)</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2 x <a href="https://www.icebreaker.com/en-au/mens-baselayers/merino-200-oasis-thermal-leggings/104369A2.html">Merino Leggings</a></td>
        <td>400</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Jeans</td>
        <td>~500</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>6 x Underwear</td>
        <td>~300</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>6 x <a href="https://www.macpac.com.au/macpac-merino-hiking-sock/114832.html">Merino Socks</a></td>
        <td>~600</td>

    <tr>
        <th>Total Items: 4</th>
        <th>Total Weight: 1800</th>
    </tr>
</table>

For the lower body, I wear merino leggings underneath my jeans for extra warmth.

Using merino socks as like before, cotton can absorb sweat, which has previously made my feet freezing in cold environments.

### Footwear
<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th>Item</th>
        <th>Weight (g)</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Shoes</td>
        <td>~500</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="https://havaianas.com.au/collections/top/products/top-thongs">Flip-flops</a></td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Total Items: 2</th>

Flip-flops are useful for avoiding dirty floors, bathrooms, and showers. They can also be used at the beach or pools.

The 40L backpack acts as my sole storage. Backpacks enable your hands to be free, making them less clunky to carry around than something like a suitcase. A 40L one is typically the largest carry-on you are allowed to bring on a plane, allowing you to skip checking-in your luggage.

I have a luggage lock to prevent it being unzipped by accident or by others. Avoid TSA luggage locks as they have a security flaw, allowing random people to open them. Additionally, TSA locks provide no benefit as they were designed for check-in luggage, not carry-on.

I use my packing cubes to store all my clothes, making them extremely easily to pack/unpack into my bag. The packing cubes are double-sided so I can move dirty laundry from a 'clean' side to a 'dirty' side.

The packable backpack is a lighter daypack that I can use when I'm able to store my 40L somewhere safe.

Although bringing a laptop is a lot of overhead, it is essential for me as it allows me to continue working on projects during my travels. A laptop sleeve protects it from impacts and water.

Avoid taking headphones, and instead opt for earphones. They are much more lightweight and compact.

Turkish towels are a lightweight quick-drying type of towel. A hand towel size is sufficient for drying your entire body, and minimises weight. Be warned that they are definitely not as comfortable as a regular towel, as they are less soft and feel much more cold while you dry yourself.

Both the toiletries and toothbrush bag are mesh to allow airflow, to possibly aid in drying any sightly wet items.

I take a dedicated toothbrush bag as most of the time I only need to take my toothbrush to the bathroom. Needing to bring all my toiletry items would be clunky and unnecessary.

Nail clipper and tweezers, although small and forgetable, can be extremely annoying to live without.

## Laundry

You can use a 5L dry bag to do your own laundry by hand.[^onebagtravels-laundry] Afterwards, you can hang your laundry on your clothesline to dry them overnight while you sleep.

A sleeping bag liner is essentially a bedsheet in a sleeping bag form. You can wrap this around yourself and place the hood over your pillow to avoid dirty bedding.

Use earplugs to mute noises like snoring hostel guests.
