Hello and welcome to my website! I created this after the realisation of two things:

1. Storing and reusing knowledge is easier than rediscovering it from scratch.
1. It is hard to go alone in this world.

With this in mind, a website allows me to:

- Store and continuously iterate on the best of my knowledge.
- Easily share ideas with others, where we can all then learn from each other in our common quest to improve our lives.

With all that being said, please feel free to browse my posts found below. Thank you for visiting :)
