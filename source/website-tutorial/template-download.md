# Downloading the Template

To skip unnecessary setup, I've created a robust repository template which lets you jump into content creation as fast as possible.

## Creating a repository from the template

Head to my [website-template](https://github.com/HammyPig/website-template) GitHub repository and click `Use this template > Create a new repository`.

Enter your own repository name (e.g. blog) and click `Create repository`. This will create a new repository with an existing initial commit that adds all the necessary files and folders included in the template.

## Enabling GitHub Pages

Head to `Settings > Pages` and change `Deploy from a branch` to `GitHub Actions`.

Then, clone the repository as you normally would.
