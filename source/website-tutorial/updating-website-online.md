# Updating the Online Website

To see our changes being made online, you only need to add your `source/` folder to your git commits, and then push them to your repository when you're ready to make the changes online.

After a couple minutes, your GitHub pages website should reflect the new changes.

And with that being done, you have successfully completed the tutorial! Please let me know if you have any additional questions you'd like me to answer :)
